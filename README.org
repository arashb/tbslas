* What is TbSLAS
TbSLAS is a parallel, fast solver for the scalar advection-diffusion and
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
TbSLAS is based on a second-order accurate implicit-explicit time integrator using unconditionally stable Semi-Lagrangian/Volume Integral method
and an arbitrary-order accurate Chebyshev octree spatial discretization.
