* What is TbSLAS
TbSLAS is a parallel, fast solver for the scalar advection-diffusion and
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using dynamic adaptive mesh refinement.
TbSLAS is based on a second-order accurate, unconditionally stable Semi-Lagrangian/Volume Integral method using an
implicit-explicit time integration with an arbitrary-order accurate Chebyshev octree spatial discretization.
